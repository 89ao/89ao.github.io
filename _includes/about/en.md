Hello, I am [Motor](https://motorao.cn/), an engineer who loves science and art, passionate about Linux, an open-source enthusiast, a performance optimization fanatic, and occasionally active on Weibo and World of Warcraft.

I graduated with a degree in Network Engineering and am currently pursuing further studies in Engineering Management after ten years of work experience. I have previously worked in operator IDC integration and delivery, as well as public cloud construction and operations. Currently, I am employed as an SRE engineer for computing products at [a cloud company](https://cloud.tencent.com/), responsible for the stability and operation of open-source software repositories.

I identify with **Engineer Culture**:

1. Problem-Solving Orientation: Aim at the target, so you won't miss.
2. Continuous Learning: There will always be things you don't know, but you can always turn the unknown into the known.
3. Team Collaboration: Journey to the West requires four people..
4. Innovation and Creativity: Change leads to progress.
5. Quality and Reliability: You wouldn't want your Golden Cudgel to break when you swing it, right?
6. Openness and Sharing: Everyone, come use Sharingan to me!
7. Ethics and Responsibility: Don't Be Evil.
