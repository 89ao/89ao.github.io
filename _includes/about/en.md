## `What I'm doing now`
#### <u>Personal 🐶</u>
Hi, I'm [Motor](https://motorao.cn/), an engineer passionate about science and art, open-source enthusiast, occasional surfer and thinker.

#### <u>Work 👨‍💻</u>
Formerly engaged in carrier IDC integration/delivery and public cloud resource pool construction/operation.  
Currently working as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) for [a cloud computing product](https://cloud.tencent.com/), responsible for open-source software repository stability construction and operations.

#### <u>Study 🙂</u>
Lifelong learner. Graduated in Network Engineering, returning to pursue Engineering Management after a decade in the workforce.

#### <u>Travels ✈️</u>
When exposed to unfamiliar environments, the human brain activates more neural network connections. Work tills the soil of reality while travel pioneers the wilderness of the mind – seemingly opposing forces that compose the complete rhythm of modern life.  
Overworking resembles over-tightened violin strings, while perpetual travel is like a bow without rosin. Their relationship mirrors the rhythm of breathing – the vital energy circulates through these alternating inhalations and exhalations.

**I embrace Engineer Culture:**

1. **Problem-Solving Orientation:** Aim at the target before releasing the arrow.
2. **Continuous Learning:** There will always be things you don't know, but you can always turn unknowns into knowns.
3. **Team Collaboration:** Three stakes support a fence; three companions – can conquer any quest.
4. **Innovation & Creativity:** Change brings breakthrough.
5. **Quality & Reliability:** You wouldn't want the Golden Cudgel to break mid-swing.
6. **Openness & Sharing:** Feel free to Copy my techniques with Sharingan!
7. **Ethics & Responsibility:** Don't Be Evil.
