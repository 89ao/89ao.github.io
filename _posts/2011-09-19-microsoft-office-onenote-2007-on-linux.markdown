About Oneote 2007
Office OneNote 2007 is a digital notebook that provides one place to gather notes and information, powerful search capabilities to find what you’re looking for quickly, and easy-to-use shared notebooks to help manage information overload and work with others more effectively. As an integrated part of the 2007 Microsoft Office system, OneNote 2007 makes it easy to gather, organize, find, and share your notes and information more efficiently and effectively. Powerful search capabilities can help you locate information from text within pictures, or from spoken words in audio and video recordings. And easy-to-use collaborative tools help teams work together with all of this information in shared notebooks, whether online or offline. Plus, the familiar look and feel of the Microsoft Office system makes it easy to start using the program right away, minimizing wasted time and training costs.

Gather and Organize Everything in One Place
With so much information coming your way–and in so many different forms–you need one place to keep it all and a tool that’s flexible enough to capture it. Otherwise, information that could have been used to help make better decisions or make you more efficient is lost or difficult to find. Unlike paper-based systems, word processing programs, e-mail systems, or other productivity programs, OneNote 2007 delivers the flexibility to gather and organize text, pictures, digital handwriting, audio and video recordings, and more–all in one digital notebook on your computer. This software can help you become more productive by keeping the information you need at your fingertips and reducing time spent searching for information across e-mail messages, paper notebooks, file folders, and printouts.

Save Time By Consolidating Information
Taking notes on paper and transcribing them later can be time-consuming and difficult, and you run the risk of losing important pages. In addition, it’s difficult to share data kept in a conventional paper notebook, and they’re only good for capturing one kind of information: handwritten notes. When it’s time to gather information from other sources and in different ways, other difficulties can arise. For instance, because most people don’t have a way of digitally capturing unstructured information, they often print out Web research, and store information in file folders or on desks, which is difficult to find later and inaccessible when you’re away. And sharing information with others can be challenging–even when using e-mail, it can be hard to hard to figure out what the plan is without reading through long e-mail threads that may or may not contain the information you need. OneNote 2007, however, gives you a solution with a flexible software program that enables you to gather virtually any type of information in one place. With your information readily available, you can be more prepared and informed.

Quickly Find What You Need
With OneNote 2007, finding information is easy and fast because it eliminates the guesswork of figuring out where you stored critical information. No more clicking through file folders and sorting through pages of paper notebooks to find the information you’re looking for. Powerful search features give you the ability to locate information quickly, while allowing you to search across new types of content, like text in scanned documents or images, and spoken words in audio and video recordings. With easier access to the facts, you and your teammates can make better decisions.

Protect Your Intellectual Property
OneNote 2007 helps you consolidate various types of information–including freeform notes, images, documents, files from other Microsoft Office system programs, and rich media–and organize it in the way that works best for you. And because it keeps everything in one place, you don’t have to worry about frequently saving or creating backups of your information–OneNote 2007 does this for you.

Ideal For Businesses
If you’re attending an important meeting and don’t want to rely on your memory, simply take meeting notes in OneNote 2007 to create a living repository of group decisions and brainstorming sessions that adds continuity and context to subsequent meetings. You can also catch all the details of customer calls and meetings by synchronizing typed or handwritten notes with Office OneNote 2007 audio and video recordings. If you’re working outside of the office, gather information on your Microsoft Windows Mobile powered devices (including notes, audio recordings, and pictures) and transfer it to OneNote 2007.

And when it’s time to share data with your colleagues, take advantage of OneNote 2007’s export application programming interface to easily transfer information gathered in OneNote 2007 to your company’s business systems, and in so doing reduce errors and wasted time spent rekeying the same information in different systems. Need to copy, paste, or print information from and into other 2007 Microsoft Office system programs? It’s no problem with OneNote; this software lets you access and exchange information in Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint. You can even use OneNote 2007’s drawing tools and tables to annotate and easily organize and manage information.

Search and Link Options
OneNote 2007 lets you search and find keywords quickly within text, in images, and in audio recordings made within the application. You can also view hyperlinked search results in a summary task pane; a single click takes you to relevant results. For added convenience, view all open notebooks at once, use drag-and-drop functionality to easily arrange and rearrange your notes, and add hyperlinks to other pages in your notebook to quickly find relevant content. Manage tasks easily with two-way synchronization between OneNote 2007 and the 2003 and 2007 versions of Outlook, or link notes and other information to specific Outlook 2007 or Outlook 2003 contacts to help you better prepare for meetings and recall information easily. If you want to underscore a particularly important point, date, or other piece of information, mark notes with note tags, visually rich icons that make it easier to return to reminders, to-dos, and other action items.

Work Together More Effectively
With team members working from different locations and on multiple projects, communication, coordination, and information sharing can challenge group effectiveness and productivity. Teams often rely on e-mail messages to share information, causing confusion and bloated e-mail inboxes. Tasks, action items, agendas, and issues stored within static documents or document management systems are difficult to update, track, and access, and they prevent multiple people from working with the same information at the same time. OneNote 2007 helps people work together better by eliminating roadblocks that arise when information is isolated in paper notes or file folders, or on one person’s computer. Groups can share information easily, work more productively, and keep track of projects, issues, and goals more effectively. Individuals can work together from the same notebook–whether online or offline–using shared notebooks. OneNote2007 manages changes made to the same notebook, eliminating the need to track versions or upload changes.

You can also create a team knowledge base so that everyone has access to the same information, helping to get new team members up to speed quickly, and minimizing duplicate efforts. Share notes even with non-OneNote 2007 users by sending your notes as HTML so that anyone with an e-mail client or Web browser can view them, and stay in control of your information by choosing which notebooks to share with your teammates and which to keep private, and help ensure privacy with password protection. You can even use OneNote 2007 as a shared digital whiteboard, enabling virtual teams to work together in real time, viewing and editing the same set of notes.

About Bordeaux 1.8.0

The Bordeaux Technology Group is a software services and development company specializing in Windows compatibility software. Users of Linux systems from time to time find themselves in the need to run specialized Windows software. The Bordeaux suite enables access to these programs and data in a seamless and low cost manner without requiring licensing of Microsoft Technology. The Bordeaux Group also provides migration services and support for alternative operating systems specializing in Windows compatibility.

There is a multitude of software developed only for the Windows operating system and even when software vendors port thier applications to another platform, generally it lacks features that the Windows version contains. The only solution these developers face is to have access to both systems for testing which leads to increased infrastructure demands, and wasted project resources. If you are vendor interested in supporting your application on Linux or a software user that needs to run a Windows application on Linux or BSD, we can help.

The cost of Bordeaux 1.8 is $20.00. Anyone who has purchased Bordeaux in the past six months is entitled to a free upgrade. Bordeaux comes with six months of upgrades and support and of course a 30-day money back guarantee.

System configuration

Linux Distribution: Gentoo
Wine Version 1.1.24
Bordeaux Version 1.8.0

Installing OneNote 2007

Start Bordeaux and select Office 2007 and when asked for the install location select your Office 2007 CD if its bundled or the appropriate location of the install media and OneNote should install and create a menu selection for you.

Running OneNote 2007

OneNote 2007 can be run from the command line or via the newly created Applications menu.

To run OneNote from the command line simply set office 2007 as your wine prefix

$ export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.bordeaux/office2007"

Then cd to your OneNote 2007 install location

$ cd /home/tom/.bordeaux/office2007/drive_c/Program\ Files/Microsoft\ Office/Office12

And run $ wine onenote.exe
Conclusions

While OneNote 2007 isn’t officially supported in Bordeaux 1.8.0 at this time, with my limited usage of the program it runs remarkably well everything has worked as expected and the program hasn’t ever crashed or hard locked.

So if you need to use OneNote on Linux or BSD this might be the time to give it a try as this very economical way of doing so.. And with enough user feedback we can further improve OneNote 2007 and officially support it in Bordeaux 2.0

Anyone who purchases Bordeuax can report any and all problems through the issue tracker and we will track them and help with any known problems and provide fixes or work arounds if necessary.
